Q:â€¢	Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

Ask the user to enter N1
Ask the user to enter N2
Ask the user to enter an operator(+,-,*,/)
if operator is '+' then
result=N1+N2
else if operator is '-' then
result=N1-N2
else if operator is '*' then
result=N1*N2
else if operator is '/' then
result=N1/N2
else if operator is '%' then
result=N1%N2
else print 'Operator is wrong'
Display result on the screen
