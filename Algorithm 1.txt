Q:•	Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). 
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.



Ask User to enter 'n'
Ask User to enter 'Nth'
Divide n by Nth
if remainder=0
print 'Nth is a divisor of n'
also if Nth is divisible by 2
print 'Nth is an even number'
else print 'Nth is an odd number'
else print 'Nth is not a divisor of n'
